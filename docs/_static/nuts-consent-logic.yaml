    This service does most of the heavy lifting around creating consent. It depends on all the other components in *service space*.

    For example, when creating a new consent request, this is send to the component it then checks if it's valid by using the validation component.

    Next it has to find the correct organizations and encrypt the record with the right public keys.

    Then it has to send the encrypted record to the Consent bridge for synchronization.


    Also when a new consent event is received by the component from the consent bridge, it needs to decrypt it and check its validity.

    If valid it has to be send to vendor space to check if the subject is really a patient for that care organization.

        During the initiation of a consent-flow, it performs the following steps:
        * Check custodian is in the list of Vendors
        * Get the consentId for the subject
        * Create the FHIR Consent-resource
        * Validate the FHIR Consent-resource
        * Get a new shared key from _crypto service_
        * Encrypt the FHIR Consent-resource with shared key
        * For each actor: get the public key from registry
        * For each actor: encrypt the shared key with actors public key
        * Create request to consent bridge

        The following steps are performed:
        * Fetch the meta data of the consent request from the consent bridge
        * Check for known active vendors in the actor list
        * Download attachments from consent bridge
        * For each known vendor:
          * decrypt the shared key
          * decrypt the FHIR consent resource with shared key
          * Validate FHRI consent resource
          * Check if the patient is known
          * Sign the FHIR consent record with private key vendor
